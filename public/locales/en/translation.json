  "about_me": {
    "main":"I am a developer from the Atlanta, Georgia in the US. My journey began with a fascination for programming during high school, leading me to major in Video Game Development in university. Entralled by Japanese games, I set my sights on becoming a video game programmer in Japan. My first job in Japan was an English teacher under the JET Programme. During this 5 year period, I took the opportunity to learn more about the culture and the language of Japan. That didn't stop me from programming though. I continued to refine my skills as a programmer by studying new languages such as C++ and Javascript/Typescript and applying that knowledge to the projects you will see on this website. Learning Javascript has led me into the world of software engineering and I am excited to learn more and apply my skills to this ever-evolving field.",
